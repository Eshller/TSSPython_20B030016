# TSSPython_20B030016
### This is week 1 assignment of the course TSSPython.
#### I have added one 'try and except statement', because when the word was not found it threw traceback error , instead I used 'try and except statement', to print "Word not Found".
#### Rest is the same, I have filled the blanks correctly and now it shows 5 words ahead and behind , in total 11 words.
## Thank you
